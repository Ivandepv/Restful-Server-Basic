# Notes

Remember you have to install node_modules with "npm i"

This project has validations and password encryption among other things, you can investigate it if it convinces you, but it is a basic project so that you can use it as a skeleton of your server and you can expand it, that is the main idea.

```
#IMPORTANT 

npm i

config .env with two variables:

PORT= (number of port)
MONGODB_CNN= (mongoDB Connection)

```
